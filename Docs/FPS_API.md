# Extra Utilities local first-person animation facade

`exu.fps` is a convenience layer over `exu.animation` for the current local
pilot/viewmodel target. It does not create a second animation runtime, resolver,
clock, or Ogre integration path.

Every mutating/read operation is equivalent to calling the matching
`exu.animation` function with:

```lua
exu.animation.TargetLocalFirstPerson()
```

That means resolver behavior, failure handling, animation metadata, playback
semantics, and future standalone EXU support remain owned by the animation
target layer rather than being duplicated here.

## API

Check whether the local first-person entity is resolvable right now:

```lua
if exu.fps.IsAvailable() then
    -- A live local first-person target exists for this operation.
end
```

Availability is dynamic. It may be false while the player is not in a pilot
view, during scene transitions, or when no supported resolver backend is
available.

Inspect capabilities/status:

```lua
local caps = exu.fps.GetCapabilities()
print(caps.localFirstPersonTarget)
print(caps.firstPersonStatus)
```

This is the same capability table returned by
`exu.animation.GetCapabilities()`.

## Read-only pilot FSM state

`exu.fps.GetPilotState()` reads the current local on-foot `Person` directly
from Redux and returns a one-operation snapshot. It does not install a hook,
change the FSM, cache the `Person*`, or modify multiplayer/gameplay state.

```lua
local pilot = exu.fps.GetPilotState()
if pilot then
    print(pilot.state)
    print(pilot.nativeState)
    print(pilot.grounded)
    print(pilot.sniperSelected)
    print(pilot.animationIndex, pilot.animationName)
end
```

The semantic crouch states correspond to the verified native
`Person+0x228` FSM:

| Native | Semantic state | Meaning |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| 0 | `standing` | base state; also owns ordinary locomotion and airborne animation selection |
| 1 | `enteringCrouch` | `stand2Kneel` transition |
| 2 | `crouched` | sniper/crouch hold |
| 3 | `exitingCrouch` | `kneel2stand` transition |

Additional raw evidence is exposed for diagnostics: `animationIndex`
(`Person+0x2A8`), `animationHandle` (`+0x2AC`), the grounded flag from
`*(Person+0x230)+0x114 & 0x80`, and the Carrier selected-weapon mask.

`sniperSelected` scans every selected live Carrier weapon using the same
native class path used by `Person::Simulate`: weapon `+0x08` →
WeaponClass signature `+0x0C`; `0x534E4950` is `SNIP`. The
`selectedWeaponSlot/signature/ODF` fields describe the first selected slot
that currently contains a live weapon, while `sniperSelected` considers all
selected live slots.

Only animation indices whose clip identities are already proven are given a
name: 0 `stand2Kneel`, 1 `kneel2stand`, 2 `idle`, 3
`fireRecoilSniper`, 10 `landParachute`, and 11 `jump`. Other indices
still return the raw `animationIndex` but leave `animationName=nil` rather
than guessing the directional locomotion mapping.

Convenience probes are derived from that same native snapshot:

```lua
local crouched = exu.fps.IsCrouched()
local grounded = exu.fps.IsGrounded()
local sniper = exu.fps.IsSniperSelected()
```

They return `nil` when no readable local on-foot `Person` exists.
`IsCrouched()` is intentionally strict: only native state 2 is true; states
1 and 3 are transitions.

Enumerate all current viewmodel animations:

```lua
local states = exu.fps.ListAnimations()
if states then
    for _, state in ipairs(states) do
        print(state.name, state.length, state.enabled)
    end
end
```

Check or inspect one animation:

```lua
if exu.fps.HasAnimation("stand2Kneel") then
    local info = exu.fps.GetInfo("stand2Kneel")
    if info then
        print(info.timePosition, info.length)
    end
end
```

Control an animation:

```lua
exu.fps.Play("idle", {
    restart = true,
    loop = true,
    weight = 1.0,
})

exu.fps.Seek("idle", 0.25)
exu.fps.Restart("idle")
exu.fps.Stop("idle")
```

## Delegation contract

The facade intentionally contains no separate target-resolution or Ogre state
logic. Internally it prepends the `localFirstPerson` target descriptor and
calls the same implementation used by:

- `exu.animation.List`
- `exu.animation.Has`
- `exu.animation.GetInfo`
- `exu.animation.Play`
- `exu.animation.Stop`
- `exu.animation.Restart`
- `exu.animation.Seek`

As a result, when the standalone EXU first-person resolver is present, the FPS
facade uses it automatically through `exu.animation`. When OpenShim is the
active resolver, the same facade uses OpenShim. Mods do not need resolver-
specific branches.

## Deliberately not included yet

This facade is presentation-only. It does not override Battlezone Redux's
`Person` animation finite-state machine.

Read-only FSM inspection is now available, but the facade still does **not**
provide semantic writes such as:

```lua
exu.fps.SetCrouched(true)
exu.fps.SetPilotAnimationProfile({...})
```

Those require the later Person-FSM interception work. Playing or seeking an Ogre animation
alone does not stop `Person::Simulate` from choosing another animation on a
later update.

Playback speed and managed animation timing are also intentionally unchanged;
Redux/Ogre remains responsible for native time advancement.
